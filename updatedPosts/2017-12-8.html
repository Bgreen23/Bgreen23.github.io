        <p>Honestly, I forgot about this assignment. But hey world, we back. Let's get caught up shall we? As a side note, this is also going to be a bit of a reflection since I'll be going down and looking back on things. Any who.</p>
        <p>It's been quite a journey, the last time I made a post was back when we were just starting JavaScript. Good news, I still don't know JavaScript! I will say that I understand the concepts we covered, it's just that I need more practice with getting my thoughts from my head into readable code. On our current project I decided to use JQuery and I feel like I'm cheating but hey, Prof. said it's ok.</p>
        <p>The amount that I learned in the short time of a month is astounding. I thought my code was passable in the real world but looking back on it has me like "Ahh was on something while writing this????".
          I definitely have had my fair share of ups and downs. But overall it's been more ups than downs.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, the feelings I have right now, good and bad, are unimportant in the grand scheme of things.</p>
