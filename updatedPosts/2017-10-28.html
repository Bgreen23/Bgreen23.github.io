        <p>This week we were assigned the last project before our final project. We also started to learn JavaScript. I also had my tech talk this week.</p>
        <p>For my tech talk I decided to do a demo using Unity. I made a small space shooter arcade style game. The demo itself was a fun side project because it required the use of C#. This was the first time I used C# and it's definitely something I plan to learn more about.</p>
