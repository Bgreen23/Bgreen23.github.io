<p>This week was a bit of a different week for me. We were assigned a project that made us use SASS, and although the project didn't go as planned it was a positive learning experience. I started the project feeling pretty confident I knew what I was doing, however I quickly realized that wasn't the case. I was struggling with the proper way to actually use SASS. The concept was there but something was missing and I couldn't figure it out. After mashing buttons for a while and ripping my code numerous times, I decided to try something different. On the second to last night before the project was due, I decided not to touch my project. Instead I spent some time that night just thinking about my code, the project, and how/why I would use different aspects of SASS such as variables. Even though I didn't technically work on my project, that night had the most influence on my project overall.I was able to gain a different perspective and attack my tasks from a different angle than before. Going forward, I'm definitely going to use the "take a step back and recollect yourself" approach but I won't wait until last minute.
</p>
<p>Tl:dr; I thought I knew how to do my code. Failed miserably, took a night to collect my thoughts and rethink project. Didn't fully finish project but gained some insight on how to get over mental blocks.</p>
