        <p>This last week was us finishing up our final project. Our project was very frustrating for many reasons and to top it off we didn't finish. It is what it is, but it just kinda sucks to not have a complete project to turn in.I've tried for a while now to get Github pages to do Github page things and I've failed countless times. I know a solution, but that would require me to completely scrap every post and start over again.</P>
        <p>We the amount we learned over this semester is super crazy. Maybe I'll spend my winter break making my old sites look up to my new standards(including this wretched hive of villany they call Github Pages).</p>
