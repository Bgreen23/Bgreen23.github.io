This week we learned about media query and how to make our websites responsive.
In all honesty, I don't see myself using media query that often because of bootstrap.
We also had a presentation from Ryan Mast this week that was very interesting. He was mainly talking about how he got to where he was and starting his own business but a few things really stood out. One of those was how he worked on Guardians of the Galaxy 2. During his presentation he described how he got a phone call to work on a movie, flew out the next day and then later on realized that it was for Guardians of the Galaxy. That type of impromptu awesomeness is something that I hope to one day achieve. Sir Ryan, if you're reading this please teach me your ways...I also awkwardly found out that the cat I would occasionally pet on my way to my car was actually his cat.
