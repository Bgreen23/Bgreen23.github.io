    This week we spent a lot of time on CSS3 properties. I did a presentation on the transition-duration property.
    The transition duration property allows you to change how long it takes for the transition to happen. I first noticed this property being used on Nintendo's website as a way to showcase their lineup of products. It is currently very supported at over 90%.
    Last week we had a presentation from David of Automattic. David currently is working on the jetpack plugin and is very active in open source communities and is a mentor for Google's Summer of Code.
    During his presentation he covered some things about his job that really interested me. He is a remote developer, which means he works away from the company office. For him, this is nice because it allows him to have time for his family and allows for him to continue living where he is without having to relocate. The concept of being able to work at home one day, in a coffee shop another day and then somewhere like the Candy Factory blows my mind. The ability to be able to flow with life as a remote developer is something that intrigues me since I want to be able to travel during my lifetime.
